# Comfy Homz Solution Website

This repository contains the source code for the official website of Comfy Homz Solution, built using React.js.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/webdivy/Archin.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd Archin
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```
npm start
```

The website should now be running locally on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Editing the Website

This website is built using React.js, which allows you to modify the code and see the changes instantly in your browser.

To edit the website, you can use any code editor of your choice. We recommend using Visual Studio Code, as it has excellent support for React development.

The main files you'll want to edit are located in the `src` directory:

- `App.js`: This is the main component that renders the website.
- `components`: This directory contains reusable React components used throughout the website.
- `styles`: This directory contains CSS files for styling the website.

After making your changes, save the files, and the development server should automatically reload the website with the updated code.

## Pushing Changes to GitHub

If you need to push your changes to the GitHub repository, follow these steps:

1. Stage the changes you've made:

```
git add .
```

2. Commit the changes with a descriptive message:

```
git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

3. Push the changes to the remote repository:

```
git push origin main
```

Replace `main` with the name of the branch you're working on, if different.

## Deploying the Website

To deploy the website to a hosting service or server, you'll need to build the production-ready version of the React app. Run the following command:

```
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized build in the `build` directory. You can then upload the contents of the `build` directory to your hosting service or server.

That's it! You should now have a basic understanding of how to work with this React app-based website for Comfy Homz Solution. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to reach out.
